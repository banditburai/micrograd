## Chunk 1

# Yin-Yang Dataset Visualization

Welcome to the Yin-Yang dataset visualization tutorial!

## Chunk 2

The Yin-Yang dataset is a classic example used in machine learning to demonstrate non-linear decision boundaries. Let's explore it using an interactive D3 visualization.


## Chunk 3

### Key Components of the Visualization:
- Blue dots: Yin class
- Orange dots: Yang class
- Green dots: Boundary class

Can you identify which color represents the Yin class?

## Chunk 4

Great! The blue dots represent the Yin class. Now, let's interact with the visualization.

Try adjusting the number of points using the slider. What happens to the dataset as you increase the number of points?

## Chunk 5

As you increase the number of points, you should notice that the Yin-Yang pattern becomes more defined and smoother.

Now, let's focus on the radii. There are two important radii in this visualization:
1. Small radius (r_small)
2. Big radius (r_big)

Try adjusting these values. What effect does changing the small radius have on the visualization?

## Chunk 6

Changing the small radius affects the size of the circular areas within each half of the Yin-Yang symbol. A larger small radius will make these areas bigger, while a smaller radius will make them smaller.

Now, try adjusting the big radius. What effect does this have?

## Chunk 7

The big radius affects the overall size of the Yin-Yang symbol within the visualization area. A larger big radius will make the symbol fill more of the space, while a smaller big radius will leave more empty space around the edges.

## Chunk 8

Congratulations! You've completed the Yin-Yang Dataset Visualization tutorial.

Key takeaways:
- The Yin-Yang dataset is useful for demonstrating non-linear decision boundaries
- D3.js can be used to create interactive visualizations of datasets
- Adjusting parameters like number of points and radii can help us understand the dataset better

In the next section, we'll explore how to use this dataset in machine learning applications!
