# Neural Networks Basics

Welcome to the basics of neural networks!

## Chunk 2

Neural networks are a fundamental concept in deep learning. They are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes, or "neurons".

## Chunk 3

### Key Components:
- Input Layer
- Hidden Layer(s)
- Output Layer

Can you list the main components of a neural network?

## Chunk 4

Let's break down the components:

1. **Input Layer**: This is where the network receives data. Each input neuron represents a feature in your dataset.
2. **Hidden Layer(s)**: These layers process the information. They apply weights to inputs and pass the result through an activation function.
3. **Output Layer**: This layer provides the final result or prediction.

## Chunk 5

Training a neural network involves:

1. Forward propagation: Data flows through the network
2. Calculating loss: Comparing output to expected result
3. Backpropagation: Adjusting weights to minimize loss

This process is repeated many times to improve the network's accuracy.

Can you explain the process of backpropagation in your own words?

## Chunk 6

Backpropagation is indeed a crucial part of training neural networks. It's the process by which the network learns from its mistakes and adjusts its weights to improve its predictions.

## Chunk 7

Congratulations! You've completed the Neural Networks Basics tutorial.

Key takeaways:
- Neural networks are inspired by the human brain
- They consist of input, hidden, and output layers
- Activation functions introduce non-linearity
- Training involves forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation
